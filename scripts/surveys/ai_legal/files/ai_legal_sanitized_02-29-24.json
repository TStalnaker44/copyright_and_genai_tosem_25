Sure, in the case of the music recording, the copyright is owned both be the writer of the music - as he wrote it, and the the player, as he preformed it. But both of them are necessary in the creation of that recording. \n\nIn the case of the input in the model - the neural networks require so much input for them to work, that none of the input is really deterministic to the end work. This would be like giving the copyright to the people that cleaned the theater and people that create the music instruments and so on, and we do not do that. So the copyright can not belong to the people, that just provided the training data. In this case, the copyright of the book could belong also to the authors of all the books that the author had read before. \n\nThere is a missing connection between this and the final work.\n\nNow the creators of the models (like OpenAI) are just creating a tool. This would mean that any picture created by a camera, the copyright would also be held by the camera manufacturing. And we do not do this. \n\nThe third is the one that is prompting the model. I could see how the prompt would be copyrighted. Since it is a creation of the person prompting. But there is no human creativity involved the process of how this specific prompt is then converted in the code (there is creativity in how the model is made and fine-tuned, but not once it is there). That would be like saying, that natural correlations or the current cloud formation can be copyrighted. That also do not make sense from the copyright perspective. \n\nSo none of these can hold. Now, if you don't have a person that can hold the copyright, then the copyright does not make sense. Sure, we have the copyright for works, where the author is unknown, but this is because it can become known in the future and in this case copyright would exist in this time. The Berne Convention (one of the international treaties) defines this as 50 years since release for books and movies. Not sure what the term would be for a code, but similar principles apply.\n\nBut in the case of the AI generated, it is not that the author is not know, it is that the author is not a living being with rights and obligation. It would be like saying that a tree can hold a copyright to the design of the apple it created. Just because its output does look like human-created, does not mean that it was created by an entity with legal standing.\n\nAlso, the point of the copyright is to protect the economic interests of the person creating the work. But here the work was not created by anything, that can have economic interests - it was just an algorithm. \n\n(Also, considering that these companies broke the copyright with training this models, I am not very keen on enabling them to now use these same laws they broke to police others)", "U14": "Anything that uses the generative AI.

LLMs (large language models) are at the core of most \u201cAI\u201d systems such as GPT-4. \n\nLLM\u2019s train on billions of sources to develop a neural network of nodes where tokens (words) are ranked based on their likely hood to be adjacent to another token. Then at a basic level when the LLM is invoked to answer a prompt, it tokenises the prompt and traces its neural network to \u201ccreate\u201d a response. This is done by finding the most likely token to be related to the tokenised prompt and then continuing to do this until a full response is formed. \n\nOpenAI (the creators of GPT) state that they do not store any of their training data however instead store urls to the training data. This means that the models only store weighted ranks of each page not the actual source. For reference, this is similar to how Google search has and still does work where page walkers scan most websites pages on the internet and rank each page based on its topic and usefulness. These rankings are then stored (not the actual pages) by Google for search queries to use to find relevant search results. \n\nLLMs can be connected to external document stores or vector based data stores/ data bases which do store entire documents or summaries of them. Retrieval algorithms are then used to retrieve documents relevant to the query to help assist the llm. This is where i believe copyright may be an issue as full documents and web pages could be fed directly into an llms context window leading to responses very similar to the documents parsed.\n\nIt is also important to note with LLMS (at a high level) tools and functions can be made accessible to llms through agents and function based models for example potentially giving them access to search the web and use that content to generate their response.

New tools/Frameworks: AI models are great for getting started quickly with new tools or frameworks. They can answer specific questions in a very efficient manner and generate example code. They can explain things tailored to my experience. For example if I say \"I'm an experienced typescript developer usually using solid-js, I'm new to vue. How can I make vue create a div and give me the reference to it (the HTMLDivElement)?\" I'm probably getting an answer in 20 seconds that I otherwise only would get in 5-15 minutes of googling and reading the documentation\n2. Hard things never done before: An example here where GPT4 helped a lot is AST manipulation (abstract syntax tree) using babel. It's like REALLY hard to understand all the methods for a newcomer of manipulating the AST, would require reading a guide or docs. With GPT4 I can just give it input code and tell it the transformations I want done and it can write me a babel plugin that does those, usually with high success rate (and it can improve when given feedback)\n2. Tests: It's great for not having to read the docs of a testing framework like jest, I can just ask \"How can I make a test for this function returning `{ test: \"succeeded\" }` and it gives me the code (I only write unit tests for things that are highly complex and likely to get bugs when they change so not that often, so AI models help a lot)\n3. When stuck: AI/ML can help greatly when I'm overcomplicating a problem in my head which makes me stuck. I just ask it to do a thing for me and then usually it's not perfect but it's easier to point out flaws in the AIs approach or come up with a better approach when already seeing a possible solution\n4. Boring code: AIs greatly help with boring, repetitive code (boilerplate). For example if I want to recurse over all files in a folder that end on .ts or .tsx I'd previously have had to read the docs of Nodejs fs module or google the individual steps. But since code like this has been written a million times, the AI can generate it with close to 100% accuracy very fast\n5. Translations: AI models are amazing at translations if you can fit enough context in their context window", "C6": "1. Apart from the benefits I listed they're fucking stupid. Everyone saying they will replace software developers or anything is just a visionary\n2. Anything where there clearly hasn't been a lot of training data on makes the AI seem insanely retarded and a waste of time. For example I'm often coding in solid-js or the solid-start metaframework and reading the docs (or code) is ALWAYS faster than using an AI/ML model due to the (at point of training) low adoption. The answers are totally useless, they just start writing react code because it's similar.\n3. A bit same as above: the answers about new features where there hasn't been a lot of code in the wild using them yet, even in much used frameworks/languages, are also often bad\n4. Context (should be further up): AI models basically have dementia, everything that you didn't say within the last 10cm text blob they start forgetting more and more. This makes them unusable for more complex problems that are the way they are due to a large codebase. They can't help with refactoring in the codebase because they're basically limited to a single file. They can't write code that interacts with other code in a complex way, because they don't see the other code, and if you feed it to them they forget and become retarded.", "C7": "I never read or skim the terms of service", "C8": "", "C9": {"answers": "Yes", "other": ""}, "C10": "Yes", "C11": {"answers": ["Other (please explain)"], "other": "I usually write a comment \"written by chatGPT\" or \"partly written by chatGPT\" to denote that if it breaks I would maybe have written it better but used chatGPT to speed up the process"}, "C12": ""}, "Understanding and Perception of Copyright Issues": {"U1": "Strongly agree", "U2": "Neither agree nor disagree", "U3": "Somewhat disagree", "U4": "Strongly disagree", "U5": "Neither agree nor disagree", "U6": "Strongly agree", "U7": "Neither pleased nor displeased", "U8": "Extremely pleased", "U9": "Extremely pleased", "U10": "", "U11": {"answers": ["Other (please explain)"], "other": "Belongs to both the people who wrote the training data, the ones who made the model and the one who prompted it.

Using such models in software development could lead to breaches of data privacy laws like GDPR or HIPAA.\n\nBias and Discrimination: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases present in their training data. Software developed using these models, particularly for decision-making processes, could inadvertently become discriminatory, leading to violations of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nCompliance and Regulatory Issues: In regulated industries (like finance, healthcare, and aviation), software must meet strict regulatory standards.
